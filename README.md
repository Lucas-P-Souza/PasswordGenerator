        generated.The existing options are: only letters, only numbers, letters and numbers, letters, 
        numbers and special characters. The user must enter the length of the password and the type of 
        password to be generated. The password is generated randomly and the characters are shuffled to 
        increase security. The user can generate as many passwords as he wants until he chooses to exit 
        the program.

# Upgrades

## For the future
    Change the way that the variables: lowercase, uppercase, digits and special_characters are defined.

## Already done
    Use only one function (generate_password) to create different types of passwords.
    Create a 'menu' to choose which type of password the user wants to build.
