## Description 

        This is a simple password generator that allows the user to choose the type of password 
        to be generated. The existing options are: only letters, only numbers, letters and numbers,
        and letters, numbers, and special characters. The user must enter the desired length of the 
        password and the type of password to be generated. The password is generated randomly, and 
        the characters are shuffled to increase security. The user can generate as many passwords 
        as they want until they choose to exit the program.

## Upgrades

### For the future
- Change the way that the variables: `lowercase`, `uppercase`, `digits`, and `special_characters` are defined.
- Find out how to implement the library `string` to make the code easier and simpler.

### Already done
- Use only one function (`generate_password`) to create different types of passwords.
- Create a menu to choose which type of password the user wants to generate.
- Use the library `tkinter` to build a window to improve the user experience.
